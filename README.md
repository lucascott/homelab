# Home Lab

My personal homelab setup. Nothing fancy but it gets the job done ðŸ˜Ž. Reliable, secure, and easy to maintain.

For more details on my hardware specifications see [here](#my-current-hardware-specifications).

## Architecture Overview

The infrastructure is built around Docker containers orchestrated using Docker Compose.
All services are exposed with Traefik as a reverse proxy, providing SSL termination and automatic service discovery via Docker container labels.

The homelab uses two main Docker networks:
- `reverse-proxy` - For services exposed through Traefik reverse proxy
- `prometheus` - For services integrating with Prometheus for monitoring and metrics collection

Web services are organized with hostname-based routing (*.lucascott.com). They are automatically discovered by Traefik using Docker labels. Internal-only services are protected with the `internalOnly@file` middleware which restricts access to the local network and Tailscale IP range.
In addition, public internet-facing services are protected by Cloudflare's WAF and DDoS protection.

All web services exposed via Traefik use the same wildcard Let's Encrypt certificate with DNS-01 challenge via Cloudflare.
This allows secure access to all public and internal only services without needing to manage individual certificates.


### Third-Party Services
* [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/) for domain registration and public DNS hosting. Cloudflare's free tier provides sufficient features for my needs.
* [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) for secure remote access to internal services when away from home.
* GitHub + Github Actions to host all my code and automate deployment of my personal website.
* [Srenity.online](https://www.srenity.online/) to find serenity in this self-hosting journey!

## Quick Start

1. **Initial Setup**
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```
   This creates the required Docker networks (`reverse-proxy` and `prometheus`).

2. **Service Configuration**
   Each service directory contains its own `compose.yaml` and configuration files. Navigate to the specific service directory and run:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

## Security Considerations

- **Internal Services**: All services not meant to be publicly exposed are configured with IP whitelisting via Traefik's `internalOnly@file` middleware. This restricts access to the local network and Tailscale IP range only.
- **SSL/TLS**: All web services are exposed via Traefik and use a Let's Encrypt wildcard certificate managed by Traefik.
- **Firewall**: The host machine runs a firewall allowing only necessary incoming ports (80, 443, 53 if using AdGuard Home).
- **User Permissions**: Docker containers run with least privilege, avoiding root user where possible.
- **Regular Updates**: Services are monitored for updates using WUD, and updates are applied regularly to ensure security patches are in place.
- **Strong Passwords**: Services requiring authentication (e.g., Vaultwarden, Portainer) are secured with strong, unique passwords.
- **Secrets Management**: Sensitive data stored in Docker secrets files (e.g., Cloudflare API tokens) in the host machine with restricted user permissions.
- **Network Isolation**: Services use dedicated networks (created automatically by Docker Compose) for secure internal communication. When necessary, individual services are connected to both `reverse-proxy` and `prometheus` networks.

## Reliability & Backups
- **Data Persistence**: Critical services use Docker volumes for data persistence in the host filesystem.
- **Backups**: Regular backups of important data are performed using custom scripts (not included in this repository) and stored offsite.
- **Uptime monitoring**: Uptime Kuma (not included in this repository yet) monitors public and internal services for availability and sends alerts via Telegram.
- **Failure recovery**: In case of a service failure, the service is automatically restarted based on Docker Compose `restart` policy.

## Updates
The What's Up Docker (WUD) service monitors for container updates. 
Update notifications are sent to me by a personal Telegram bot integrated with WUD.

Most services are configured with:
- `wud.watch.digest=true` - Monitor for image updates
- `wud.tag.include/exclude` - Control which tags to monitor
- `wud.link.template` - Direct links to release pages

Updates can be applied via WUD UI's Docker trigger button, via Dockge UI, or manually by navigating to the service directory and running:
```bash
cd <service-directory>
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d --remove-orphans
```

## Monitoring
- **Prometheus**: Collects metrics from cAdvisor and other exporters
- **Grafana**: Visualizes system and application metrics
- **Logs**: Container logs available via `docker compose logs`

## Contributing

When adding new services:
1. Create a new directory with descriptive name
2. Include `compose.yaml` with proper network configuration
3. Add Traefik labels for automatic routing
4. Create service-specific README with setup instructions
5. Update this main README with service information

## Future Improvements
- Include missing services in this repository:
  - Uptime Kuma configuration for service uptime monitoring
  - Backup scripts/configuration and documentation
- Explore hosting an SSO identity provider (e.g., Keycloak) and integrate it with services for unified authentication
